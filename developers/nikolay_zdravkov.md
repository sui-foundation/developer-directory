## Experience Statement

Senior Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development, system architecture, and performance optimization, with over 9 years of experience. I enjoy working on complex technical challenges—whether it's integrating AI into finance tools, implementing enterprise identity solutions, or optimizing infrastructure for scale. Over the years, I’ve contributed to a wide range of domains including finance, gaming, and e-commerce, always with a hands-on, curious mindset.

My journey with Sui began as a personal research project aimed at exploring its capabilities and understanding what can be built on top of it. I was particularly impressed by its dedicated programming language and unique semantics. I later participated in and completed the Sui Move Bootcamp in Thessaloniki, which covered full-stack blockchain development.

Currently, as a hobby, I'm working on yield optimization solutions for DeFi.
